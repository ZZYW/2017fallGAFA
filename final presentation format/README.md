###Final Presentation Blog Format

### 1. Summary: Dream about one day you become a famous new media artist and your project is written by an art curator on the Art section of New York Times. Try to provide a concise overview about the overall concept of your project.

### 2. Inspiration: Be personal. Think about a feeling you had, a relationship, a question that always confuses you yet you wish to learn more about. Include some visual reference here – concept maps, images, sound, gifs, artists websites, your favorite novelists or movies or comic books, the more the merrier.

### 3. Research: Use this section to document more technical references. A creative technologist who have accomplished a similar project, a software you want to try, some tutorial that might be helpful to go over at some point.

### 4. Process: What experiments have you tried so far? What did you like and not like about them? What are the next steps you might want to take to further develop your project? Include screencaps of what you have done so far in this section, and list out a few more steps for further action.

### 5. Visual Documentation: Depending on the nature of your project, documentation can take on the form of Images, Screencaptures, Gifs, Short demo videos, Infographics, or any form that helps an audience who is hearing about your project the first time to understand it, both artistically as well as conceptually and technically.

When you are done, don’t forget to pick a name and header image for your project (the header image doesn’t have to be yours, just something that helps you feel inspired). If it helps, try to think of writing this blog as paraphrasing the following paragraph into a project proposal and add images/references wherever you see fit.

As a new media artist, I am interested in using creative technology to explore/research/investigate_________________. I became interested in this topic when___________________. I would like my audience (students) to interact with this piece by________________. I would like them to feel__________________. Technically, I think these are the steps needed to test my concept: __________________. I have researched into a few similar projects, such as _________________(provide visual references). I think in the next few weeks, I would like to use the class time to find out how to________________. Visually, I would like my piece to look like ________________(provide visual references).

Feel free to alter any of the above format to help you find your voice, identity and creative process. The main objective is to use this writing space to establish a process where you can use repeatedly to bring together artistic and technical inspiration, for the purpose of appropriating your own authentic voice with tangible shapes and forms.
